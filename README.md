# ShipRoutingSystem
Using the concepts of DSA ie (Trees, Djikstras Algorithm, Queues and GUI using JavaSwing) this project gives a representation about how a ship management works ie with respect to Passenger or a cargo Service.
Use NetBeans Latest version to run the code or use Eclipse for faster response.
The Java code provided implements a shipping route simulation application using JXMapViewer, a part of the JXMapKit for Java Swing applications. The main functionality revolves around managing a map viewer connected to OpenStreetMap, setting up ports globally with pre-defined routes, and visualizing these routes using color-coded paths. The ShipRouting class extends JPanel and integrates UI elements for user interaction, such as selecting start and end ports and buttons for initiating route display and ship animation along the shortest calculated path. The application also dynamically updates the map to show routes, animates a ship icon along these routes, and provides detailed ship and route information through a text area at the bottom of the UI.
